# AGEJLE-OS  
**Advancing Gulf Coast Environmental Justice Leadership & Engagement in Open Science**

This repository documents and disseminates open-science deliverables produced under the NASA
Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Transform to Open Science (TOPS) award:

**Grant:** NASA SMD TWSC 22-TWSC22-0090  
**Project:** Advancing Gulf Coast Environmental Justice Leadership & Engagement in Open Science (AGEJLE-OS)  
**Principal Investigator:** Nathan Morrow, Tulane University

## Project Overview

AGEJLE-OS was a capacity-building and convening project focused on strengthening community-led,
academically supported open science in the U.S. Gulf South. The project supported environmental
justice (EJ) organizations and academic partners in developing open-science skills, collaborative
research concepts, and competitive proposals using NASA Earth science data.

The project aligned with:
- NASA’s **Transform to Open Science (TOPS)** mission  
- SMD’s **Strategy for Data Management and Computing for Ground-breaking Science**  
- The **Open-Source Science Initiative (OSSI)**

## Objectives

AGEJLE-OS objectives were to:

1. Support community-engaged researchers in obtaining **open science certification badges**
   using NASA TOPS materials.
2. Facilitate **collaboration on open science projects** that use NASA Earth science data to
   address climate and environmental justice priorities in the Gulf South.
3. Strengthen **proposal development capacity** for NASA-funded, community-led,
   academically supported open environmental justice research.
